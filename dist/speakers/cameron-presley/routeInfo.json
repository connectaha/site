For some, it's aggravation because they're a waste of time, for others, it's stressful because it feels like you're getting a review. However, for some, it's a great learning experience that leads to the team improving. Do you want to be in the latter group? Then this talk is for you!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll start by looking into the goal of code reviews and why we should be doing them. From there, I'll show you the common mistakes that teams make with code reviews and how to fix them. To wrap things up, I'll show you what I do when performing code reviews.\r\n\r\nIntended for developers of all levels, attendees will understand the reason why we should have code reviews, signs of bad reviews, signs of good reviews, and have some ideas to take back with them.","organization":"SentryOne","photoUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b83400da358894a0dde39a26d69a73d1?s=500","photo":"/photos/speakers/cameron-presley.png","room":"sw","time":"1:30"},"nextId":"cassandra-faris","previousId":"brian-wohlers"}}

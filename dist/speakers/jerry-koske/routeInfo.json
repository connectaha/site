Like many in our field, growing up on a well-fed diet of science fiction inspired my imagination and illuminated the potential to change the world with technology.  As a technologist, I am an addict – lucky enough not only to enjoy my job but also to be infatuated with our industry.  I try to focus this passion into learning how to best influence positive change and make a difference.  I also really enjoy craft beer.","title":"Disciplined Development: What is dead may never die","description":"Dave Thomas, one of the Agile Manifesto’s creators famously wrote a post titled “Agile is Dead” nearly 6 years ago.  In practice the term Agile can unfortunately be used as a silver bullet, a panacea - snake oil from salesmen and consultants of dubious character who often provide underwhelming results.  We all observe how projects tend to go, and often lecture each other on how we are doing Agile wrong, stopping at the point of rhetoric.  Surely Agile isn’t fundamentally flawed… or is it? \r\nIn this session we will discuss personal observations I’ve made over the past 20 years of working with over 50 agile projects across numerous industries.  I’ll provide published trends and data that feed into these observations, highlighting common issues encountered. Finally, I’ll demonstrate how from the ruins of failed agile initiatives effective development can rise again harder and stronger.","organization":"Aviture","photoUrl":"","photo":"/photos/speakers/jerry-koske.jpg","room":"eb","time":"9:00"},"nextId":"joel-tosi","previousId":"jennifer-blatz"}}

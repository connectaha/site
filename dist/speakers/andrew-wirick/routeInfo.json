On the surface, the term sounds like something great for designers. But what's the value in it for other technical roles?\r\n\r\nAfter demystifying the term \"design system\", we'll dive into the differences in day-to-day life with the developer, quality assurance, and product owner roles. I'll discuss some of the responsibilities that non-designer roles typically have as part of a well-implemented design system. If your company's software doesn't yet have an intentional design system, I'll talk through some great starting spots for designers and non-designers alike.","organization":"Buildertrend Inc.","photoUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c88f878b659d5b406c240361bba0ae5a?s=500","photo":"/photos/speakers/andrew-wirick.png","room":"nw","time":"2:45"},"nextId":"ash-banaszek","previousId":"amanda-perkins"}}

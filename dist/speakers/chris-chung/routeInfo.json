I get energized by working one-on-one or in teams on problems that seem complex from an organizational change management stance, but are really simple.  It's important to me to channel my energy in the events that will help grow the skills of others because only then can they help the whole group move forward. ","title":"Secret Backlogs","description":"Across the five fundamental events of scrum, each has a varying degree of maturity and success.  This session looks to introspectively analyze how backlog grooming, planning, standup, demo, and retro are powerful team building and culture tools but how our previous experiences have shaped them into something else entirely.  Themes of \"Secret Backlogs\", \"Place Holder Planning\", \"Sit-down Stand-ups\", \"Lack of Demos\", and \"Touch-and-Go Retro\" are indications of areas where team members need to coaching and support to become high performing again.

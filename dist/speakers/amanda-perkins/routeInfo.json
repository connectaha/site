I have a background in customer service and music and feel that these skills help me to think outside the box when it comes to quality. I am currently pursuing my degree in Leadership at Norwich University and feel that the additional skills I’m learning there will help me take QA even further.\r\n","title":"Travels through the Looking Glass: My journey from Customer Service rep to Automation Test Engineer","description":"The road we travel in our jobs (and our lives) is not always smooth, but sometimes, it takes falling down the rabbit hole to lead you on the yellow brick road to your very own Oz.  It doesn't matter where you start; it's about where you end up.  Using pop culture references, we'll discuss the journey I took to get from Customer Service Rep where my understanding of IT was a couple people in a closet like office to working as a QA in a waterfall software shop for a university to Automation Test Engineer and Lead QA.  I want to share my experience with others to show that we've all traveled down different roads but our experiences and knowledge shape how and what we test as we're testing, from how we interact with a mobile app to how we test that new website to how we write up a bug ticket.  Everything we’ve done before comes with us into testing, and it’s what shapes us to do what we do best!

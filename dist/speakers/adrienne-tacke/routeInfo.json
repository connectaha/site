Yet, most applications I worked on heavily relied on user interfaces and an otherwise object-oriented architecture, so the decision to move to F# or some other functional programming language didn't make sense. \r\n\r\nDespite this, many principles and patterns from functional programming DID make sense to implement for cleaner and more robust code. Important paradigms like immutability, method chaining, and using expressions over statements were certainly things even C# developers could take advantage of! In this talk, I want to demonstrate how C# developers can implement these beneficial patterns and principles and explore how doing so ultimately results in better code!\r\n\r\n","organization":"Self-Employed","photoUrl":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/38211/atacke-headshot-md.jpg","photo":"/photos/speakers/adrienne-tacke.png","room":"nw","time":"1:30"},"nextId":"alison-hawke","previousId":"scott-connerly"}}

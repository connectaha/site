Of all the values that support psychological safety, trust is the most foundational. But how do you build trust, especially in situations where people have been burnt before? Just like in building technology, iteration and experimentation can get us there. In this talk I explore when team experiments are useful, how to structure them, how to manage expectations around them. and I'll share stories of my own experiments and how they've panned out.","organization":"aware3","photoUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/935ee156ea847441833a1a32bb803284?s=500","photo":"/photos/speakers/scott-connerly.png","room":"se","time":"9:00"},"nextId":"adrienne-tacke","previousId":"sandi-barr"}}

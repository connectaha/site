My goal is to write code that breaks code to make a better product for the user. I train technical testers who can help a team release awesome products that make client's lives better. I've been in QA since 2005 and I love getting into the code to test more thoroughly. I've written test code in Java, C#, JavaScript, and Elixir. Outside work, I'm a black belt in Chinese Kenpo and have fun sparring every week. I also knit a lot of hats. Originally from England.","title":"Building a QA practice from scratch","description":"When you're the only QA, how do you build a quality assurance practice?  Thinking about recruiting, training, fun, multiple remote offices, delegation, velociraptor-avoidance techniques, staffing, snacks, blood, sweat, and tea. I'll share the potholes we fell into so you can fall in different ones.","organization":"World Wide Technology","photoUrl":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/14941/KCDCportraits0241_lower_quality_and_small.jpg","photo":"/photos/speakers/alison-hawke.png","room":"sw","time":"11:30"},"nextId":"allen-wu","previousId":"adrienne-tacke"}}

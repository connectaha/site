My goal is to write code that breaks code to make a better product for the user. I train technical testers who can help a team release awesome products that make client's lives better. I've been in QA since 2005 and I love getting into the code to test more thoroughly. I've written test code in Java, C#, JavaScript, and I am currently learning Elixir. Outside work, I'm a black belt in Chinese Kenpo and have fun sparring every week. I also knit a lot of hats. Originally from England.","title":"A Hero's Journey: Manual Tester to Automation QA","description":"**Prologue: Once Upon A Time in Software**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce there was a project that was frustrating, it had lots of bugs and made the team unhappy. For the next project, we tried something new: the QA on the team would learn C# and she would write automated tests before the developers started coding. The team was happy, and the app runs to this day with only bugs caused by bad data the client told us could never exist. \r\n\r\nThe end. Or is it really... The Beginning?\r\n\r\nThis talk is the story of a learning quest, what I've discovered along the way teaching QAs to write test automation in Java, C#, and JavaScript, and my own journey of picking up new languages for fun, like Elixir. It is aimed at QA testers who want to broaden their testing skills, and at developers who want to help them get there. No prior coding knowledge is required for the QAs.","organization":"WWT Asynchrony Labs","photo":"/photos/alisonHawke.jpg"},"nextId":"arthur-doler","previousId":"thomas-cleberg"}}

What about the power of CSS? CSS has received a bad name as of late, but truth of the matter is that CSS is such a powerful piece of the front-end puzzle and you should really be excited for what's already here and what's to come! Who would have thought we could create magazine-style layouts with CSS grid? What about ruleset variable scoping with custom properties(CSS variables)? And last but not least, the pain of centering content horizontally and vertically which is now possible in three lines with flexbox! Let's talk about how awesome CSS is, and how we can restore our faith in one of the best things that makes the web amazing!","organization":"Tuft & Needle","photoUrl":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/4238/Headshot-4.jpeg","photo":"/photos/speakers/chris-demars.png","room":"sw","time":"9:00"},"nextId":"christine-seeman","previousId":"chris-chung"}}

She came to tech by way of childhood website-building (a _\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"_ fansite, to be exact). Before joining Ten Forward, she spent several years as a professional radio journalist in Lincoln, Nebraska, and attended Omaha Code School.\r\n\r\nHilary volunteers regularly with several tech and community organizations, and co-runs [Madison Women in Tech](http://madisonwomen.tech), a local group with more than 1,800 members. She loves board games, garlic-stuffed olives and bourbon barrel-aged stouts. She’ll read any fantasy or sci-fi she can get her hands on.\r\n\r\nShe tweets puns and intersectional feminism at [@hilarysk](http://twitter.com/hilarysk).","title":"Using our powers for good: Tech and social impact","description":"Want to make a difference in your community, but don’t know how, or feel like you don’t have time?\r\n\r\nYou’re not alone. Luckily, there are a number of ways you can use your tech-industry skills to create positive change in your community - and yourself! (Fun fact: volunteers live longer and make more money than those who don’t volunteer.)\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore the why’s, how’s, and where’s for sharing our skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll learn more about the breadth of ways to give back, and hopefully leave feeling empowered to reach out in your own community and start making connections.","organization":"Ten Forward Consulting","photoUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cf1a104aa1d9b44fdf49658c59f4aea3?s=500","photo":"/photos/speakers/hilary-stohs-krause.png","room":"nw","time":"10:15"},"nextId":"jake-partusch","previousId":"heather-terenzio"}}

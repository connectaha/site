For the next project, we tried something new: the QA on the team would learn C# and she would write automated tests before the developers started coding. The team was happy, and the app runs to this day with only bugs caused by bad data the client told us could never exist. \r\n\r\nThe end. Or is it really... The Beginning?\r\n\r\nThis talk is the story of a learning quest, what I've discovered along the way teaching QAs to write test automation in Java, C#, and JavaScript, and my own journey of picking up new languages for fun, like Elixir.

Starting a new job, especially if it’s your first one, is always exciting... and stressful. Here’s how to take control of the situation and make sure that you’re ready to start strong from day one. As superficial as it sounds, you want to look your best when you are meeting so many people for the first time. But you should dress appropriately for your environment - a suit would be out of place in most technical organizations. The what not to wear part is easy… but what should you wear? Getting the people part right is key.First, ask a lot of questions. Use the 70/30 rule -- ask questions 70% of the time and share your stories and ideas 30% of the time. This is your chance to learn about the company, your project and the people that you will be working with, so you want to spend most of your time listening. Be ready with a plan for getting up-to-speed, even if all the parts are not in place when you start.

I have a passion for helping people, and I take that into my management role in form of coaching my reports to become better engineers, finding the best ways to motivate them, and providing them with authentic connections and meaningful relationships.","title":"Inverting the Management Relationship","description":"In most manager/employee relationships, the employee is a resource for the manager. The manager has a goal, something they are responsible for, and the employee is helping them to meet their goal. When it goes well, the manager is also providing feedback and coaching that helps the employee improve and grow their career. When it doesn't go well, the manager's goals trump the needs of the employee, and the employee must sink or swim. Often times, these two dynamics are at odds with each other and can even put the manager in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nAt Hudl, we took a different approach. We used a form a matrix management where managers don't typically work on the same team as their reports. We removed the delegating aspect from management, and this led to a completely different dynamic in the manager/report relationship. It actually inverted the relationship where it is now clear that the manager is a resource for the report. Our managers focus their efforts on coaching and growing the skills of their reports. Our successes are seeing our reports meet their goals. \r\n\r\nThis dynamic provides an interesting mix of pros and cons. I'll talk through those as well as the logistics of running a product team with this structure. My goal is for anyone in a more traditional org structure to start thinking about the benefits of changing up their structure.","organization":"Hudl","photo":"/photos/gregDick.jpg"},{"id":"jason-swett","firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Swett","bio":"Jason Swett helps Rails developers write better tests.

Legacy projects tend to be lacking in test coverage. Unfortunately, legacy projects are often written in such a way that it makes it difficult to add tests - tests that are badly needed in order to start paying down technical debt and get the project on the right track.\r\n\r\nFortunately there are some effective ways of wrangling legacy code into submission. If we can break apart a legacy project's entanglement of dependencies, making the code more modular and loosely coupled, we can add tests more easily. But breaking apart dependencies is tricky and requires a few certain techniques in order to be done safely.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n- Why legacy projects are harder to test than greenfield projects\r\n\r\n- Why adding tests to legacy projects is risky\r\n\r\n- How to mitigate the risks of modifying legacy code\r\n\r\n- What dependency injection is, why it’s useful in testing legacy projects, and how to use it\r\n\r\n- How to break dependencies using Michael Feathers’ “sprout class” technique","organization":"","photo":"/photos/jasonSwett.jpg"},{"id":"javier-lozano","firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Lozano","bio":"Javier is founder of Lozanotek, Inc., a Microsoft focused software development boutique based in Des Moines, IA.

These levels are combined to make user interfaces.\r\n\r\nReact, at its core, follows Atomic Design inherently by encouraging developers to keep components as simple and as broken down as possible. From this simplicity, we can create more complex components and containers of components to create the user interfaces for our applications. Following these patterns gives us, as developers, an easy to manage (and test) ecosystem within our React applications.\r\n\r\nDuring this talk, we'll dive into the roots of Atomic Design and how we can apply these design principles to our React applications.","organization":"Balance Innovations","photo":"/photos/katiaWheeler.jpeg"},{"id":"mat-warger","firstName":"Mat","lastName":"Warger","email":"mwarger@gmail.com","bio":"Mat Warger is a consultant with Keyhole Software.

QA folks, do you believe that developers have tested their work before they hand it over? You may identify with this atmosphere of contention surrounding QA. But there’s one underlying question for every team: are we building a quality product?\r\n\r\nThe definition of quality should go beyond a list of test cases executed against requirements. From the father of the quality revolution, Edward Deming, to the work of Martin Fowler and Mike Cohn, we’ll lay a theoretical groundwork for what quality is, then we will showcase these definitions with examples. We’ll end with specific activities along the software development life cycle that actually help assure quality.

We took the idea of an Internship, and made it AWESOME! The Intern Program is team based, and allows a small group of software development students to work together on a team along with four or five full-time mentors and leaders to create a greenfield enterprise application. The experience allows the students to iterate through the full software development life cycle in an enterprise environment: from sketching out wire-frames to deploying an enterprise application in Production. \r\n\r\nWe will also talk through how we do our intern interviews differently. Our interviews do not consist of the traditional sit-down interview with questions. We have a fun and relaxed process that let's the candidates express their creativity, collaboration, problem solving, and their personality. This helps to insure that we are investing in people that fit our culture.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest benefits to our approach is that the students get an experience of what life is like in the real world. The amount of learning that happens when you apply the theory that's been learned in school across the entirety of the software development life-cycle in highly-collaborative enterprise team environment is indescribable.

Even if the schedule was correct, plans don't always go the way you expect and become off track. Teams end up working more extended hours, try to add people to the project or make other heroic efforts to try and “save the day’ and finish on time.  In my experience, rarely have those efforts worked and when it did, the team was so burned out it took several weeks to get motivated to tackle another project.\r\n\r\nThere should be a better way to complete projects on time, so teams feel a sense of accomplishment and are excited to take on the next project.

One of purposes of TypeScript is to “statically identify constructs that are likely to be errors”. With NgRx we can take advantage of this type safety by using TypeScript classes as action creators with readonly type properties, so we can then infer the action object types in our state management code.\r\n\r\nNgRx provides a structuring mechanism for larger applications; it's a design pattern teaches you how to think. In this pattern, the developer needs to identify the streams of values the application is interested in and how they are combined to produce meaningful information for the view layer. The streams, the various applications states, and the view layer models are what we are setting out to define when we use Redux-style state management. This talk will show how to use the various NgRx reactive libraries for Angular state management to build out our application streams and then consume them in our components and services.\r\n\r\n","organization":"PRX","photo":"/photos/sandiBarr.jpg"},{"id":"simon-yost","firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Yost","bio":"I empower teams to close the gap between design and engineering so that digital experiences connect people.

Simultaneously, two-thirds of all business leaders believe that their companies must pick up the pace of digitalization to remain competitive (Moore, 2017). Yet, even with this demand, teams implement solutions that lack of agility. Tangoe’s Murray lays it out: “Developers are coding to specific spec sheets with little conceptual understanding of how this button or feature fits within the overall user experience.”\r\n\r\nThe lack of agility and conceptual understanding of the whole results in a gap—the fidelity gap—where the marriage design and engineering is not as strong as the product creators intended. Symptoms may include a lack of consistency, responsiveness, navigation, and accessibility (Abramov, 2018).\r\n\r\nJoin Simon Yost to explore filling the fidelity gap with stack-neutral concepts and practices that engineering and design teams can work together to champion on any stack.","organization":"Slalom Consulting","photo":"/photos/simonYost.jpg"},{"id":"thomas-cleberg","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Cleberg","bio":"","title":"Model Management: The Least You Can Do","description":"Data science projects are most visible right after initial delivery, but the data science team’s responsibility goes far beyond that.

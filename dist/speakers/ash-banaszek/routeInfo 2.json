I have a passion for teaching and getting folks to that \"ah-hah\" moment about UX. I am an avid proponent of creating technology people want to use--instead of technology that get people so frustrated that they want to chuck it out of a window.  I'm also a huge Bioware nerd and will talk your ear off about Mass Effect or Dragon Age if you dare only ask...","title":"Fear, Pain, and Loathing: Empathizing with your Users' Plight","description":"You're a developer given a relatively straightforward assignment: replace an old application with a new technology. \"Make it easy to use... Make it sharp! Oh, and don't change anything.\"\r\n\r\nThis session discusses the basics of user interface usability from a user's perspective. When your application is live, the user is the person who will be using that system day in and day out. They determine your application's success or failure by adopting, undermining, or abandoning your application. With such importance, it is imperative to have some understanding of your users' requirements, constraints, and goals. This session will help you develop skills to build empathy and better communicate with your users, while also meeting the needs and requirements of your project stakeholders.","organization":"Union Pacific","photo":"/photos/ashBanaszek.jpg"},"nextId":"beth-laing","previousId":"arthur-doler"}}

When your application is live, the user is the person who will be using that system day in and day out. They determine your application's success or failure by adopting, undermining, or abandoning your application. With such importance, it is imperative to have some understanding of your users' requirements, constraints, and goals. This session will help you develop skills to build empathy and better communicate with your users, while also meeting the needs and requirements of your project stakeholders.","organization":"Union Pacific","photo":"/photos/placeholder.jpg"},"nextId":"beth-laing","previousId":"arthur-doler"}}

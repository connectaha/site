Having seen that technology can be both a barrier to entry and a gateway to opportunity, she has worked in her local community to provide tech education to folks who may not otherwise have access. She's held NodeSchool and Django Girls workshops, is an organizer for NEJS Conference, and worked with organizations to create a sense of belonging for those who are underrepresented in tech.","title":"Design Thinking for Inclusive Collaboration","description":"How can Design Thinking help us build more collaborative and inclusive teams? The process involves seeking out diverse perspectives to better understand user needs. This reduces the impact of our cognitive biases, which then also helps to find alignment across differences and leads to more creative solutions. It changes the conversation by reframing the problem around user-driven criteria. Design Thinking involves and values all team members throughout the process and results in building the best solution for our users. As we walk through the process step-by-step, attendees will gain insights they can leverage to introduce a design thinking mindset within their organization and learn how it can be used as a tool to collaborate effectively within and across teams.","organization":"PRX","photoUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/40b13a365c9d251119637cb8c17f61a2?s=500","photo":"/photos/speakers/sandi-barr.png","room":"ne","time":"11:30"},"nextId":"scott-connerly","previousId":"ryan-hochstetler"}}
